                            SatEmLat is a team founded in 2019 to participate in CanSat Portugal. This project revolves
                            around building and coding a satellite the size of a can.

                            In 2019, I and five others participated in the team SatEmLat and won an award for Best
                            Teamwork. The next year, with a slightly different team, we participated again. We were
                            through to
                            the competition, but due to the pandemic, they got postponed to 2021. In that edition of
                            CanSat, we won the award for Best Technical Performance.

                            I studied at CNSR all my life. There I got a great education and a strong science background
                            with a lot of hands-on learning.
                        </p>
                        <p> Over the years, I got the chance to participate in multiple activities at my school. I was
                            able to win school robotics competitions, be a member of the Student
                            Association, reach C1 Advanced level in Cambridge English and go to the European Parliament
                            with a few other students as a reward for being the best Ambassador School in Portugal.
